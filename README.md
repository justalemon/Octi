Octi is a simple Jekyll them created to be a cute dark theme with pink and purple everywhere, using the beautiful [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font that I have always loved.

It's meant to be a basic yet feature rich with features like:

- Open Graph protocol and Twitter Card support
- Configurable Footer with Socials (WIP)
- Mobile-friendly
- Specific page to show your projects

And more!
